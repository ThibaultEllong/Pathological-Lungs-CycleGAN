# Pathological-Lungs-CycleGAN
Implementation of CycleGAN architecture for data augmentation of a pathological lungs CT-Scans dataset.

---

The goal of this project is to artficially generate pathological lungs CT-Scans paired with the segmentation mask of the lung area. These image-mask pairs will serve for the training of a segmentation model. Indeed, such models struggle with segmentation of lung areas in the presence of peripheral diseases, as they are visually indistiguishable from surrounding tissues.
